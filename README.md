## Before Starting

Create DockerHub account and create a repository within DockerHub. 

Install Docker

* [Windows](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)

Finally, install an IDE for Javascript (e.g Visual Studio Code)

## What is Docker

Allows us to create virtual machines (or containers) which run an application. Containers to can be networked together to allow our application to talk to each other. This provides great support for allowing us to write infrastructure as code.

Once everything is installed move to the branch `Stage1-containers` to start.
